##  Project Overview

![Dashboard Screenshot](static/assets/dashboard-screenshot.png)

**NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine** Astro-Biome: NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine is an advanced, AI-powered platform crafted for the [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/).  
Our mission is to transform NASA's vast archive of space biology research and publications into a dynamic, interactive resource—making critical bioscience knowledge accessible for researchers, engineers, and mission planners.

---

##  The Challenge

**NASA** has generated thousands of **space biology** research articles, experiments, and data points over decades. However, accessing, understanding, and connecting relevant information remains a significant challenge.
Our solution, Astro-Biome, leverages AI, Machine **Summarization**, **Knowledge Graphs**, and Conversational **Chatbot** | **UX—so** users can instantly search, **summarize**, and interact with the latest findings.
Beyond simple **summaries**, Astro-Biome highlights each article’s **objective**, detects whether results are **positive** or **negative**, shows which **topics** are well-studied, and uncovers **research gaps** that still need exploration.

---

##  Core Features

1. **Multi-source Data Crawling & Indexing :** Automated extraction and indexing from 11 major scientific sources (Task Book, NSLSL, PubMed, PMC, EuropePMC, CrossRef, medRxiv, NCBI, doi.org, arXiv, and NASA-exclusive datasets).
2. **Smart Search & Advanced Filtering :** Rapid search by topic, year, study type, keywords, or source with semantic and lexical query support.
3. **AI Summarization (Transformer & RAG) :** Generates concise summaries, multi-level abstracts, and analytical insights using state-of-the-art NLP models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).
4. **Biomedical Knowledge Graph :** Visualizes relationships across concepts, genes, conditions, publications, and experiments for structural understanding.
5. **Interactive Dashboard & Visual Analytics :** Trend charts, study distributions, and visual outputs for presentations and research.
6. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) :** Listen to research summaries and chatbot responses for accessibility and rapid review.
7. **Summary Validation :** Confidence scores for summary accuracy and alignment with the original text.
8. **Export & Sharing :** Download results, reports, and knowledge graphs as CSV, PDF, or shareable links.
9. **Responsive, Shareable UI :** Modern dashboard and chat interface for desktop and mobile.
10. **Scalable & Extensible :** Easily add new sources, models, or analytical modules.
11. **Advanced Chatbot Astro-Biome :**  
    - Natural, multi-modal conversational interface powered by GPT-4o  
    - Understands context, research intent, and provides guided search planning  
    - Supports text, voice, image, and multimodal interactions  
    - Capable of generating scientific illustrations, analyzing research, and providing expert-level answers in astrobiology and space bioscience
